multiple linear regression :1 continuous dependent variable  using two or more independent variable.

interpretations  of  coeff :

| Feature  | Coefficient |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Area     | 150         |
| Bedrooms | 12000       |
| Age      | -2500       |

Area = 150
1000 sqft
↓
1001 sqft
Price increases by ₹150

Bedrooms = 12000
Every additional bedroom increases price by ₹12,000, assuming Area and Age remain constant.

2 Bedrooms
↓
3 Bedrooms

Price increases by ₹12,000

Age = -2500
Every additional year decreases price by ₹2,500.
House Age = 10
↓
House Age = 11
Price decreases by ₹2,500

============================================

multicollinearity :two or more indep variable highly correlated with each other. 
ex: area ----> number  of rooms ----> window 
means if rooms  inc then it more window 

prlm :
Make coefficients unstable
Change coefficient values significantly with small data changes
Make feature interpretation unreliable
Reduce trust in the model

==============================================
pip install statsmodels  
from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor 

detecting multicollineartiy using VIF :variance inflation factor

VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) measures how much the variance of a coefficient is increased because of multicollinearity.

VIF stands for Variance Inflation Factor.
It measures how strongly one independent variable is correlated with the other independent variables.
area  ----> bedroom , age 
bedrrom ---> area ,age 
age  ---> bedroom , area 

Remember:VIF does not compare a feature with the target (Price).
ex : 
VIF checks relationships like:

Area  <------> Bedrooms
Area  <------> Age
Bedrooms <------> Age

It does not check:
Area ------> Price

| VIF Value | Meaning                                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1         | No correlation                                                     |
| 1 -5      | Acceptable                                                         |
| 5 - 10    | High correlation (investigate)                                     |
| >10       | Severe multicollinearity (consider removing or combining features) |

The regression model predicts house prices reasonably well, but the VIF analysis reveals severe multicollinearity between Area and Bedrooms. Since these two features are highly correlated, their coefficient values are unstable and should not be used to judge feature importance. The Age feature has a low VIF, so its coefficient is more reliable. Before interpreting feature importance in Multiple Linear Regression, always check the VIF values.
